### Beer Blurrer
Developed a frame-work to detect and blur alcoholic content in images. The first part of the frame-work is a YOLO-V3 model deployed to detect beer bottles. The later part of the frame-work involves an unique adaptive thesholding algorithm for blurring the detected bottles. Acheived a MAP score of 99.19 %. <br> <br>

### Points and Co-ordinates
A 3 dimensional interactive mathematical environment was constructed using HTML and Javascript. This work is an open source contribution that was done during my intern at SHRIP, IIIT Hyderabad in 2019. <br><br>

### CoDoH: Classification of DNS over HTTPS
Two statistical models were utilized to perform two different classification tasks. The first one is to classify the network traffic as DoH vs Non-DoH, and the second one being the classification of Benign DoH vs Malicious DoH. Fine inferences were drawn from the results and the highly impacting features were explained and justified for each class. <br> <br>

### Automatic Image Captioning
Developed a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines in computer vision and text generation. The encoder is an Inception V3 model which extracts the feature vectors. The decoder made up of LSTMs, predict the captions conditioned on the image's feature vectors. <br> <br>

### Trigger Word Detection
A neural network was designed to identify the trigger word 'Mervin' from the spectrogram of the given audio sample. CNNs were used to extract dense feature vectors from the audio spectrograms. Later GRUs were utilized to capture the temporal relationship in the extracted feature vectors. <br> <br>

### Toxic Comments
Toxicity in wikipedia comments were identified using Gated Recurrent Units(GRUs). The built model achieved a training accuracy of 95.3 % and was deployed using Streamlit<br> <br>
