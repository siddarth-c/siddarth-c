## Beer Blurrer
Developed a frame-work to detect and blur alcoholic content in images. The first part of the frame-work is a YOLO-V3 model deployed to detect beer bottles. The later part of the frame-work involves an unique adaptive thesholding algorithm for blurring the detected bottles. Acheived a MAP score of 99.19 %. <br> <br>
