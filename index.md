### Beer Blurrer
Developed a frame-work to detect and blur alcoholic content in images. The first part of the frame-work is a YOLO-V3 model deployed to detect beer bottles. The later part of the frame-work involves an unique adaptive thesholding algorithm for blurring the detected bottles. Acheived a MAP score of 99.19 %. <br> <br>

### CoDoH: Classification of DNS over HTTPS
Two statistical models were utilized to perform two different classification tasks. The first one is to classify the network traffic as DoH vs Non-DoH, and the second one being the classification of Benign DoH vs Malicious DoH. Fine inferences were drawn from the results and the highly impacting features were explained and justified for each class. <br> <br>

### Automatic Image Captioning
Developed a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines in computer vision and text generation. The encoder is an Inception V3 model which extracts the feature vectors. The decoder made up of LSTMs, predict the captions conditioned on the image's feature vectors. <br> <br>
